# Fix icon cursor X11
You'd need to put your mouse cursor theme in _/usr/share/icons/_ , however if you already have a cursor theme in your $HOME I think it would be better if you make a symlink instead.

Now edit _/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme_ and edit Inherits= to the name of your cursor's theme.
